# Laughing Stock

Laughing Stock is a simple site geared towards providing users with valuable information regarding the ex

As a user, I want an app and site to deliver an ever growing list of venues and stand-up performers.

End user goal: As a user, I want to view various descriptions in order to make an educated decision on if a certain venue, performer, or combination of both are worth their time.
 
End business goal: Venues and performers may want to advertise on site in order to increase awareness of thier respective future events.
 
Measurement of success: Engagement and individual contribution will translate into the growth of the data for all data entities.

## Next Steps
Would have loved to separated the states and cities of each venue as their own property, as to more easily reference them by location. Also would love to implement google maps API for the same reason for ease of access to directions should a user show interest in venue.

Would have also like to have an "event" model, that can only be created to and deleted from by an admin (node repl?), that would link performers to upcoming "events" AT a preferred "venue". I can see many possibilities for bugs in this implementation, so would require frequent maintenance, but I personally would love to see when and where performers of choice will be anh given weekend.
